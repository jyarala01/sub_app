# QuickSub  

## 🚀 Hackathon Project Overview  
**QuickSub** was developed during **SwampHacks X**, the University of Florida's largest student-run hackathon, held on **January 25-26, 2025**. It addresses the challenges substitute teachers face when finding and applying for positions at nearby schools. Our goal is to streamline the process and create a user-friendly platform to connect schools in need with available substitutes.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Substitute teachers often struggle to find schools in need of their services, while schools face difficulty in filling these crucial positions efficiently. Current processes are often outdated and inefficient, leaving gaps in the education system.  

**QuickSub** bridges this gap by creating a **centralized platform** where substitute teachers can easily discover nearby schools, view available positions, and apply.
